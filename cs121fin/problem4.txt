You can put your answers for Problem 4 in this file.  Follow this notation for
writing your answers in text format:

 * You can write functional dependencies as A -> B

 * You can write a set of functional dependencies as { A -> BC, C -> D }

 * You can write attribute-set closure as {A}+ etc.

 * You can write multivalued dependencies as A ->> B

 * You can write explanatory text as plain-text without any kind of comment
   markup.

 * Keep all lines to 80 characters or less!

 * When writing relation schemas, you can indicate primary-key attributes
   by enclosing them with asterisks, e.g. R1(*A*, B, C), R2(*C*, D)

 * Don't forget that primary key attributes should always come first
   when writing relation schemas

-- [Problem 4a]
order = {*order_id*, cust_id, order_time}
cust_id is a foreign key to customer.cust_id
This schema is obviously in	4NF	because	it is also in BCNF: All	functional 
dependencies that hold on this table have order_id on the LHS, and order_id 
is the primary key of this relation	schema.

customer = {*cust_id*, cust_address, cust_phone}
This schema is obviously in	4NF	because	it is also in BCNF: All	functional 
dependencies that hold on this table have cust_id on the LHS, and cust_id 
is the primary key of this relation schema.

pizza = {*pizza_id*, order_id, pizza_size}
order_id is a foreign key to order.order_id
This schema is clearly in 4NF because pizza_id is a superkey of R

pizza_topping = {*pizza_id*, *topping*}
pizza_id is a foreign key to pizza.pizza_id
This schema is in 4NF because pizza_id ->> topping is a trivial multivalued 
dependency.


-- [Problem 4b]
It's not possible to make a schema that is in BCNF and not 4NF because to
be in BCNF and not 4NF would require a non trivial multivalued dependency
where the LHS is not a super key of the relation. In this case the LHS
of the only nontrivial multivalued dependency is super key.
