Write the relational model schema for your airline database in this file, using
the notation we have used all term.  You can indicate primary key columns by
enclosing the attribute names in _ characters.  Include descriptions of other
candidate keys or foreign keys (if any) immediately under each relation schema.
Example:

foo(_a_, b, c)
 * b is also a candidate key
 * c is a foreign key to bar.c

-- [Problem 4]

flight(_flight_number_, _flight_date_, time, source, destination, international, type_code)
* type_code is a foreign key to type_code to airplane.type_code 
* NOT NULL constraint on flight.type_code

airplane(company, model, _type_code_)

seat(_type_code_, _seat_number_, seat_class, seat_type, exit_row)
* type_code is a foreign key to type_code to airplane.type_code 

customer(customer_id, first_name, last_name, email)

customer_phone(_customer_id_, _phone_number_)
* customer_id is a foreign key to customer.customer_id

purchaser(_customer_id_, cc_number, exp_date, verification_code)
* customer_id is a foreign key to customer.customer_id

traveler(_customer_id_, passport_number, country, emergency_contact, ec_phone_number)
* customer_id is a foreign key to customer.customer_id

purchase(_purchase_id_, purchase_time, confirmation_number, customer_id)
* customer_id is a foregin key to purchaser.customer_id
* NOT NULL constraint on purchase.customer_id
* confirmation_number is a candidate key for purchase
* I moved customer_id here rather than make a relationship schema because it is a many to one 
* total participation relationship to purchaser so you can just combine them

ticket(_ticket_id_, sale_price, flight_number, flight_date, type_code, seat_number, purchase_id, customer_id, first_name, last_name)
* flight_number is a foreign key to flight.flight_number
* flight_date is a foreign key to flight.flight_date
* type_code is a foreign key to seat.type_code
* seat_number is a foreign key to seat.seat_number
* purchase_id is a foregin key to purchase.purchase_id
* customer_id is a foregin key to traveler.customer_id
* first_name is a foregin key to traveler.customer_id
* last_name is a foregin key to traveler.customer_id
* NOT NULL constraint on ticket.flight_number
* NOT NULL constraint on ticket.flight_date
* NOT NULL constraint on ticket.type_code
* NOT NULL constraint on ticket.seat_number
* NOT NULL constriant on ticket.purchase_id
* NOT NULL constraint on ticket.customer_id
* NOT NULL constraint on ticket.first_name
* NOT NULL constraint on ticket.last_name
* (flight_number, flight_date, seat_number) is a candidate key
* I combined all of the ticket relations into ticket becasue the relationships are many to one with total particiapation so you can
* just combine the schemas.
